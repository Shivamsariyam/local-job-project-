        <h3>3. Experience With CodeYogi</h3>
        <p>I joined CodeYogi on February 12, 2024, after being introduced to it by my school's principal. In this program, I have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am currently studying React. I practice coding by watching YouTube videos, answering questions on Telegram, and working on assignmentsâ€”all of which I do on my mobile.</p>

        <h3>4. My Future plans</h3>
        <p> I want to become a web developer because my family's financial situation is not ideal, and I believe this career will help improve it. I also plan to study Node.js after completing React, and then pursue a course in AI development. </p>
